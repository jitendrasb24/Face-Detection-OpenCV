# Face-Detection-OpenCV

#### Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.

#### Some examples of pre-trained classifiers are:-

***haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml***

***haarcascade_frontal_cat_face.xml***
